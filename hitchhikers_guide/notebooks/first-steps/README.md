# First Steps with Delta Lake
> Note: The content and guide here is all dedicated to Delta Lake 101. While the Hitchhiker's Guide is focused on Delta Lake Streaming, we can't start with Streaming before we understand the ins/outs of working with Delta Lake.

## How to Learn using the First Steps
For starters, if you are new to using Delta Lake, head over to [delta.io](https://delta.io/) to get the million foot introduction. Then we can start working together and tackling Delta 101.

1. [Streaming First Steps](./streaming-first-steps.ipynb) provides you with a simple journey. You'll learn to create a Delta Lake table using the `DeltaTable` python utility. Then we'll populate the table, and run our first streaming job. (I promise this will be a breeze!).

> Note: This is work in progress. Please open up an [Issue](https://github.com/newfront/hitchhikers_guide_to_deltalake_streaming/issues) if you find things that seem out of place. Just be nice.
